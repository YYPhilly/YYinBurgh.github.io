## Student Recruitment
I’m actively recruiting students who are excited about designing and building human-centered computing systems to improve people’s personal wellbeing and to achieve greater social good. Generally, prospective students should have strong interest in at least one of my research areas: **human-computer interaction (HCI), usable privacy & security, privacy-enhancing technologies, health informatics, ubiquitous computing, and applied machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI)**. 

### Prospective Ph.D. Students
I have Ph.D. positions in <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/cems/cs" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/" target="_blank">Unversity of Vermont (UVM)</a>. starting Fall 2022. Strong candidates should be self-motivated, passionate about research, interested in human-centered computing, and have programming skills. Ph.D. students at UVM typically are funded with full tuition and a stipend. You may learn more about the Ph.D. program <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/cems/cs/graduate_programs/computer_science_phd" target="_blank">here</a>.

I'm looking for candidates with ANY of the qualifications (1) prior experience in designing, implementing, and evalutating interactive systems; (2) skills in developing user-facing web/mobile applications; (3) knowledge in machine learning/artifical intelligence (ML/AI) and problems with ML/AI; and (4)interdisciplinary research backgrounds (e.g., information science, social science, pyschology). **Candidates from under-reprensented groups in computing are stronly encrouaged!**

Interested individuals may contact me with the following information: (1) a brief introduction of yourself;(2) your CV or resume; (2) **a short description of how research interests align with my research expertise**; and (4) representative publications or writing samples (course papers are okay). The subject of the email should start with “[Prospective-PhD]”. I will reach out if there is a potential good fit.

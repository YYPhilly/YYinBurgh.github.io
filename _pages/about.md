I'm an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/cems/cs" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/" target="_blank">Unversity of Vermont</a>. Before that, I was a posdoctoral reseearcher in the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a>.

I'm a human-centered computing researcher, with strong interdisciplinary expertise in human-computer interaction (HCI), usable privacy & security, privacy-enhancing technologies, health informatics, ubiquitous computing, and applied machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI). I investigate both social and technical research topics to ensure the use of peopleâ€™s personal information/data is appropriate, fair, and meaningful, particulary by emerging computing and information technologies. Specifically, I design human-centered privacy-enhancing technologies that help people effectively manage their data privacy on the web, on their mobile devices, and with the increasingly ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.

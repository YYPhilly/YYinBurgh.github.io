![UVM Logo](/images/UVMLogoSolid.png)

I'm an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/cems/cs" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/" target="_blank">Unversity of Vermont</a>. Before that, I was a posdoctoral reseearcher in the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a> and earned my Ph.D. in Information Studies from the <a href="http://drexel.edu/cci/" target="_blank"> College of Computing &amp; Informatics </a> at <a href="http://drexel.edu/" target="_blank">Drexel University</a>.

My research is at the intersection of **human-computer interaction (HCI), usable privacy &amp; security, privacy-enhancing technologies, health informatics, ubiquitous computing, and applied machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI)**. I investigate both social and technical research topics to ensure the use of peopleâ€™s personal data is appropriate, fair, and meaningful, particulary by emerging computing and information technologies. I also design and build human-centered data privacy tools that help people effectively manage their data privacy on the web, on their mobile devices, and with the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.
